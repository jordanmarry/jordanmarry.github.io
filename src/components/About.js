                I am currently a research engineer at Parallel Software and Systems Group. 
                Currently working on a Python-based tool for analyzing execution traces from
                parallel programs. I also recently just graduated from the University of Maryland - 
                College Park.

                Outside of school and work, I tend to play videos, catch up on the current 
                world of astronomy, and hang out with friends.
